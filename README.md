Simple Menu
===========
This is a very simple slide out menu. No frills. jQuery required. Should probably end up using variables with LESS or SASS.

See it [in action](http://aforty.github.io/simple-slideout-menu/) or,  clone, `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`, and finally open http://localhost:8000.
